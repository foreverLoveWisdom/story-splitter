# Contributing to Story Splitter

Thanks for your interest in improving story breakdown for Product Owners!

## How to Contribute

### 1. Suggest a New Prompt (Idea)

**Have a problem that needs a prompt solution?** File an issue first.

**Process**:
1. Go to [Issues](../../issues/new/choose)
2. Select "Prompt Idea" template
3. Describe your problem (not the solution)
4. We'll discuss if it needs a new prompt

**Why issue first?**
- ✅ Validates real demand (not theoretical problems)
- ✅ Avoids duplicate prompts
- ✅ Community can suggest existing solutions
- ✅ Maintainers decide if it fits project scope

**What happens after**:
- If validated → Someone creates the prompt
- If duplicate → We point you to existing prompt
- If out of scope → We explain why

### 2. Improve Existing Prompts

**Found a better way to phrase a prompt?**

1. Fork the repository
2. Edit the prompt file (`prompts/*.md`)
3. Test it with ChatGPT/Claude
4. Submit Pull Request with before/after example

**PR Requirements**:
- Show example output (before and after)
- Explain why your version is better
- Keep prompt under 500 words

### 3. Add Real Examples

**Used a prompt successfully?** Share your story!

1. Fork the repository
2. Add to `examples/` directory
3. Use `before-bad-story.md` format
4. Submit Pull Request

**What makes a good example**:
- Real project (anonymize company details)
- Shows actual impact (time saved, surprises avoided)
- Before/after comparison
- 200-300 words max

### 4. Fix Bugs or Typos

Small fixes welcome via Pull Request directly. No issue needed.

## What We DON'T Accept

- ❌ Prompts without validated demand (file issue first)
- ❌ Overly complex prompts (> 500 words)
- ❌ Prompts for non-Product Owner audiences
- ❌ Time-to-points mappings (story points ≠ hours)
- ❌ Tool-specific instructions (keep it generic)
