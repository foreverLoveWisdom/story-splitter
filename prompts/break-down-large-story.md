```
Break down this user story into smaller stories.

Context:
- My team prefers to work [HORIZONTALLY / VERTICALLY]

Note:
- HORIZONTALLY = Backend first → Frontend second → Integration third (easier for teams, but users wait longer)
- VERTICALLY = Full feature (backend + frontend + integration) in each story (harder for teams, but users see value faster)

Rules for breakdown:
- Max 8 points per story (team decides what 8 points means)
- 3-5 acceptance criteria per story (not more)
- Each acceptance criteria must follow this format:
  Given [situation]
  When [user does something]
  Then [system responds]

Here is my story:

[PASTE YOUR STORY HERE]

Please:
1. Tell me if this should be broken down HORIZONTALLY or VERTICALLY (explain why based on my team's preference and deadline)
2. Break it down using that approach
3. For each smaller story, give me:
   - user story, use the format: Start with: "As a [who], I want to [what], So that [why]"
   - 3-5 acceptance criteria
```
