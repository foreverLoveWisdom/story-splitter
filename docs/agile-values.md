# Agile Values

## The One Thing

Agile prioritizes **people and collaboration** over processes and tools.

## 4 Core Values

From the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org):

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

*There is value in the items on the right, but we value the items on the left more.*

## 12 Principles (Condensed)

- Satisfy customers through early and continuous delivery
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
- Deliver working software frequently (weeks not months)
- Business people and developers must work together daily
- Build projects around motivated individuals
- Face-to-face conversation is most effective
- Working software is the primary measure of progress
- Maintain a constant pace indefinitely
- Continuous attention to technical excellence
- Simplicity - maximize the amount of work not done
- Self-organizing teams produce best results
- Regular reflection and adjustment

## AI Collaboration Context

When using story-splitter prompts:
- **Responding to change**: Break down large stories so you can adapt quickly
- **Working software**: Small stories = frequent delivery
- **Customer collaboration**: Use Given-When-Then format so users can validate ACs
