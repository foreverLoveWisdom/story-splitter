# Story Points

## The One Thing

Story points measure **complexity**, NOT hours or days.

## Why Not Hours?

❌ **"3 points = 2 days"** creates false precision
✅ **"3 points = simple story"** focuses on relative complexity

Each team's velocity is different:
- Team A: 20 points per sprint
- Team B: 40 points per sprint
- Same stories, different velocities

## Fibonacci Sequence

Common scale: **1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13**

- **1-2 points**: Trivial (few hours)
- **3 points**: Simple (couple days)
- **5 points**: Moderate (few days)
- **8 points**: Complex (almost full sprint)
- **13+ points**: Too large, needs breakdown

Gaps between numbers force team to choose - no false precision like "7 points".

## Team Velocity

**Velocity** = Total points completed per sprint

Used for planning, NOT individual performance measurement.

Example:
- Sprint 1: 18 points completed
- Sprint 2: 22 points completed
- Sprint 3: 20 points completed
- **Average velocity**: ~20 points/sprint

## Why We Removed Time Mappings

This repository previously showed "3 points = 2 days" - we removed it because:
- Story points ≠ calendar time
- Each team determines their own velocity
- Mapping creates wrong expectations

## AI Collaboration Context

When using story-splitter prompts:
- Prompts suggest "Max 8 points per story"
- Your team decides what 8 points means
- Use INVEST criteria, not time, to validate size
